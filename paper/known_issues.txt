- The order of the arguments for "repeater_from" changed, but this order-change didn't get piped down all the way to the definitions of ackermann and hyperop.
- We didn't put in the Coq definition for "alpha", which is used (line 416) in the definition for inv_ack.
- The historical note was a little off once we took out the binary stuff. Should have discussed multiplication, division, exponentiation, logs. Rather than numerical position systems. 
- Need to sync up listings' line numbers with line numbers in code
- Need to add hyperlinks to GitHub permalinks using \href
- Some of the numbering is funny. Definition 3.4 followed by Remark 3.4, Theorem 3.7 followed by Definition 3.6, etc. Go in and fix manually?
- Anshuman would like to explain a little bit that "budget" is a lot like "gas", which is talked down in \S1.2. However, budget is better because we always take care to show that it can be calculated at reaonably low time cost.
- Not in love with the REPT/CONTR notation
- Need a more systematic notation for worker viz countdown worker

Anshuman has added notes in pages 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13
