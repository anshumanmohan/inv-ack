- The order of the arguments for "repeater_from" changed, but this order-change didn't get piped down all the way to the definitions of ackermann and hyperop.
- We didn't put in the Coq definition for "alpha", which is used (line 416) in the definition for inv_ack.
- The historical note was a little off once we took out the binary stuff. Should have discussed multiplication, division, exponentiation, logs. Rather than numerical position systems. 
- Need to sync up listings' line numbers with line numbers in code
- Need to add hyperlinks to GitHub permalinks using \href
- Some of the numbering is funny. Definition 3.4 followed by Remark 3.4, Theorem 3.7 followed by Definition 3.6, etc. Go in and fix manually?
- Immportant typo: in Definition 6.1, we mean ``α(n, n) and α(n) are not equal or related''. α(m, n) and α(n) have no reason to be equal. 
- In Definition 6.2, need to clean up the \foralls. They can just be removed.
- Ditto for Theorem 6.1
- Some of the Bib items need to be {C}apitalised manually
