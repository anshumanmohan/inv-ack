- The historical note was a little off once we took out the binary stuff. Should have discussed multiplication, division, exponentiation, logs. Rather than numerical position systems. 
- Need to sync up listings' line numbers with line numbers in code 
	Anshuman says: 
		On further thought, I think this is unnecessary. They already link to the code. Besides, the line numbers will be a bit off anyway because we have made unified listings out of code that is actually in different parts of the same file.
- Anshuman would like to explain a little bit that "budget" is a lot like "gas", which is talked down in \S1.2. However, budget is better because we always take care to show that it can be calculated at reaonably low time cost.
- Not in love with the REPT/CONTR notation
- Need a more systematic ligature/notation for worker viz countdown worker

Anshuman has added notes in pages 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13
