The operations successor, predecessor, addition, and subtraction have
been integral to counting since time immemorial. The ancient Egyptian 
number system used glyphs denoting $1$, $10$, $100$, \emph{etc}, 
and then expressed numbers using additive combinations of these.
The Roman system is similar, but  
it combines glyphs using both addition and subtraction. This buys brevity, 
since \emph{e.g.} $9_{\text{roman}}$ is two characters, ``one less than ten'',
whereas $9_{\text{egyptian}}$ is nine characters, a series of nine $1$s. 
The ancient Babylonian system was, just like the modern Hindu-Arabic decimal system,
an \emph{algorism}: the place value of a glyph determined how many times it would 
be counted towards the number being represented. 
The Babylonians operated in 
base $60$, and so \emph{e.g.} a three-gylph number $abc_{\text{babylonian}}$ could 
be parsed as $a \times 3600 + b \times 60 + c$. {\color{magenta}Sadly they lacked 
a radix point, and so 
$a \times 216000 + b \times 3600 + c \times 60$ and $a \times 60 + b + c \div 60$ 
were also reasonable interpretations.} In return for incorporating the operations
multiplication and division, they enjoyed great brevity indeed: a number $n$ could 
be represented in $\lfloor \log_{60}n \rfloor + 1$ glyphs.

{\color{magenta}A brief sentence explaining what a primitive recursive function is and 
why total computable functions tend to be primitive recursive.}
The orignal three-variable Ackermann function was discovered by 
Wilhelm Ackermann as an example of a total computable function that 
is not primitive recursive \cite{ackermann}. 
It grows tremendously fast, but does not have the higher-order
relation to repeated application and hyperoperation that we have been studying in
this paper. Those properties emerged thanks to refinements by Rózsa Péter \cite{peter},
and it is her variant that computer scientists commonly care about.

\marginpar{\tiny \color{blue}implemented with the heuristic 
rules of \emph{path compression} and \emph{weighted union}}
The Ackermann-Péter function is mostly a toy curiosity, but its inverse 
occasionally features in the time bound analyses of algorithms. 
Tarjan \cite{tarjan} showed that the union-find data structure
takes time $O(m\cdot\alpha(n))$ for a sequence of $m$ operations
involving no more than $n$ elements. 
Chazelle \cite{chazelle} showed that the minimum spanning tree
of a connected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges 
can be found in time $O(m\cdot\alpha(m,n))$.

Moving on to mechanized verifications, Charguéraud and Pottier,
\cite{charpott} later joined by Guéneau \cite{gueneauetal}, 
extended Separation Logic with the notion of ``time credits'',
formalized the~$O$ notation in Coq, 
and gave a proof in Coq that simultaneously verifies the correctness
and the time complexity of the union-find data structure. Several others 
\cite{others2, others4, others3, others1} 
have explored the idea of checking bounds on the resources
used by programs formally in proof assistants such as Coq, Isabelle/HOL, and Why3.
{\color{magenta}This is a direction
we intend to explore to formally check the $O(n)$ bound
of the inverse Ackermann function.}
