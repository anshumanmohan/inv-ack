\paragraph{Hyperoperations and their inverses.}

Successor, Predecessor, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Algorisms.  Representations of numbers (Egyption fractions/Roman numerals/Decimal/Zero).  Exponentiation, Logarithm, Tetration, Log*, ...   Hyperoperations, Knuth Arrows.  Inverses as a separate notation?

Mechanizations of the above?

\paragraph{The Ackermann function and its inverse.}

Several variations.  Original.  Peter.  Primitive recursive.  Hilbert?  Ackermann is used in CS.  Formalizations that use or define it.

The grit of sand.  The bug.

Cite: Ackermann, Peter, Tarjan, Chazelle, Pottier, ?  Anything in HOL?  Anything in SSReflect?

\paragraph{Alternative strategies.}

Division by constant, etc. is simpler.

Custom termination metrics.  Gas.  Mutual recursion.  Automata.  Alternative implementation strategy?  (Space, tail recursion, time?)

\paragraph{Other?}
