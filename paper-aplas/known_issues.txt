- The historical note was a little off once we took out the binary stuff. Should have discussed multiplication, division, exponentiation, logs. Rather than numerical position systems.
	Anshuman: Leaving to Aquinas, or leaving until a discussion with Aquinas 
- Need to sync up listings' line numbers with line numbers in code 
	Anshuman: 
		On further thought, I think this is unnecessary. They already link to the code. Besides, the line numbers will be a bit off anyway because we have made unified listings out of code that is actually in different parts of the same file.
- Not in love with the REPT/CONTR notation
	Anshuman:
		Made a quick change that I like better, but still not the best.
- Need a more systematic ligature/notation for worker viz countdown worker
	Anshuman:
		Made a proposal on the chat.
- Notation of upper inverse is quite confusing with the -1 and the +. 
	Anshuman:
		How about just -1, or the subscript + replaced with an upward arrow?

- For binary rep, please edit the names of functions etc. Add something like "_bin" to all names, in the code and the paper. 

Anshuman has added notes on pages 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13

Some noncontroversial TODOs after seeing the reviews:
5. Test Makefile 
7. acknowledge Chargu√©raud and Pottier's repeater
9. disclaimer that the practical hardcoded solution is obvious, we are trying to win in theory-land
11. I think A(m, n) should have a different notation than the diagonal A(n). Proposed an example in Definition 1 but not yet piped through everywhere.
14. Shall we remove the pedantic sub_2 from Section 5.2?
15. There are many broken \refs to {defn: inv-ack-hier} in file inv-hyperop.tex and inv-ack-improve.tex
