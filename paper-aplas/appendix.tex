\section{Binary Numbers in Coq}
\label{apx:bin_in_coq}
Coq has support for binary numbers with the type \li{N}, which consists 
of constructors \li{0} and \li{positive}:
\begin{lstlisting}
Inductive positive : Set := 
  | xI : positive -> positive | xO : positive -> positive
  | xH : positive.
\end{lstlisting}
Constructor \li{xH} represents $1$, and constructors \li{xO} and \li{xI} represent 
appending $0$ and $1$ respectively. 
By always starting with $1$, \li{positive} dodges
the issue of disambiguating \emph{e.g.} the numbers \li{011} and 
\li{00011}, which represent the same number but pose
a minor technical challenge. 
To represent $0$, the type \li{N} simply provides a separate constructor \li{0}.
